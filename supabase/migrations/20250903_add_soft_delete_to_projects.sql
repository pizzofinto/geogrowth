-- ADD SOFT DELETE SUPPORT TO PROJECTS TABLE
-- ============================================================================
-- Migration: 20250903_add_soft_delete_to_projects.sql
-- Purpose: Add soft delete functionality to projects table
-- Author: Claude Code - Sprint 3 Project Deletion Implementation
-- Date: 2025-09-03

-- Add soft delete columns to projects table
ALTER TABLE projects 
ADD COLUMN deleted_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NULL,
ADD COLUMN deleted_by_user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) DEFAULT NULL;

-- Add index for performance on deleted_at queries
CREATE INDEX idx_projects_deleted_at ON projects(deleted_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_projects_active ON projects(id) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Add comment for documentation
COMMENT ON COLUMN projects.deleted_at IS 'Timestamp when project was soft deleted. NULL means project is active.';
COMMENT ON COLUMN projects.deleted_by_user_id IS 'User ID who performed the soft delete operation.';

-- ============================================================================
-- UPDATE RLS POLICIES TO EXCLUDE SOFT DELETED PROJECTS
-- ============================================================================

-- Drop existing RLS policies on projects table (we'll recreate them)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable read access for assigned users" ON projects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable insert for authenticated users" ON projects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable update for assigned users" ON projects;

-- Recreate RLS policies with soft delete filter
CREATE POLICY "Enable read access for assigned users" ON projects
    FOR SELECT USING (
        deleted_at IS NULL AND
        is_assigned_to_project(id)
    );

CREATE POLICY "Enable insert for authenticated users" ON projects
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
        auth.uid() IS NOT NULL
    );

CREATE POLICY "Enable update for assigned users" ON projects
    FOR UPDATE USING (
        deleted_at IS NULL AND
        is_assigned_to_project(id)
    );

-- Add policy for soft delete operations (only project managers and super users)
CREATE POLICY "Enable soft delete for project managers" ON projects
    FOR UPDATE USING (
        deleted_at IS NULL AND (
            project_manager_user_id = auth.uid() OR
            has_role('Super User') OR
            has_role('Supplier Quality')
